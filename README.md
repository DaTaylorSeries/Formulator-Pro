## What is Formulator Pro?
Formulator Pro (FP for short) is a desktop application that is designed to formulate products for companies off of proprietary recipes. Each Formulator Pro is different in its own way and may formulate products differently or different products in general.

## How Does Formulator Pro Work?
For starters, Formulator Pro is coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is built with ElectronJS. This is done so that multiple versions of the same application do not need to be coded and can be built with the same source code.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is the upmost piece of the application that allows the user to navigate through the app. At all times the user can be directed back to the home screen by clicking on the, "Home" button found in the navigation bar. Other options are present on different screens that allow the user to navigate in different ways.

### Home Screen
When the application first loads the user will be greeted by the home screen. In this home screen the user will see different options for different product categories.

    Product Category 1/2 - Pretty self explantory.
    R&D - Is an option to create a sheet that will produce a new product.

When a user first sees these options, simply hover over the option and a menu will drop down giving a choice in all of the products that can be chosen. Simply choose a product and click on that selection.

### Product Home Screens
After a product category has been chosen, the user will be greeted with different choices depending upon what product category has been chosen. The different choices can be broken down to as such:

    Flavors - Different flavor choices for a specific product category.
    Scents - Different scent choices for a specific product category.
    Standard - The default choice for a specific product category since there aren't other options.

After choosing one of the above options a user will be directed to the choice that they clicked on. This will lead them to what is called the Record Sheet

---

### Record Sheets
From here there are some basic inputs that are required from the user. They are as follows:

    Name - Name of the chef / formulator.
    Date - Date the product was made.
    Batch Number - The specific batch number for said product.
    # of Batches - How many batches are desired to be created.
    Purity - The purity of the focused ingredient (THC, CBD, CBG etc.)
    Desired mg / Oz - The desired mg / Oz of the focused ingredient.
    Speciality ID - The ID of the focused ingredient (For record keeping).

After these have been filled out. Ont the bottom left is a flask icon that will populate the field of the recipe sheet. In the bottom right is a print icon which will allow users to print said recipe once the inputs have been filled.

It should be noted that only some of these options for inputs are present depending on the type of product that is being created.

### R&D

The R&D Sheet is designed to be a blank template that can be used to create new products. The difference between the product record sheets is that this sheet is designed to not do any formulating, instead it will create blank sheet.

In the bottom left, click either the plus or minus button to add new rows to the table. The user can then proceed to input what they wish, or leave it blank to be filled in on a sheet of paper.
